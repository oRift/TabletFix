# What is Controlify?
Controlify is the best controller support mod for Minecraft: Java Edition. It exceeds the first-party Bedrock Edition controller support in every way possible. It is feature-complete, with support for vibration, gyroscope, HD haptics, and more.
Controlify supports all controllers, thanks to its usage of the SDL3 library, which is the most advanced cross-platform input library available.
Controlify is designed to be both user-friendly and feature-rich. It has sensible defaults, with default sensitivity matched to Bedrock Edition for easy transition, and a simple yet informative settings screen that allows you to tweak your experience to your liking.
